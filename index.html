                <p>Here is my <a href="https://salma-rodriguez.github.io/FinEngPrimer/index.html">financial engineering training</a></p>
                <p>Here is my <a href="https://salma-rodriguez.github.io/Securities-Experiment/index.html">financial time series project</a></p>
                <p>This is an experiment of my own with exchange-traded futures contracts. I borrowed an Excel workbook from a course I had taken earlier; the course was provided by the department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research at Columbia University. I have completed the first notebooks in Jypter Lab with computer code in Python.

                        </ol>
                </p>
                <p>I will be making further updates as I complete my first notebook and make a second notebook that will include a treatment of swaps on underlying futures contracts (swaptures).</p>
